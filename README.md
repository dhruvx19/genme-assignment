 # Flutter Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up and run a Flutter project. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Flutter SDK**: Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install the Flutter SDK.
2. **Dart SDK**: The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter, so you don't need to install it separately.
3. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
4. **IDE**: (Optional) Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA with Flutter and Dart plugins for a better development experience.

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run the following command to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvx19/genme-assignment.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory using the cd command:

```bash
cd your-flutter-project
```

### 3. Fetch Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the project dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```
